# Tales in Branches 

## Chapter 1: The First Commit
In the beginning, there was only an empty repository.  
A lone developer wrote the very first file, marking the root commit.  
It was small, but it was the foundation upon which the entire project would grow.

## Chapter 2: The Branching Begins
The first branch was created, diverging from the main flow.  
On this branch, the story unfolded with new ideas and changes,  
each safely isolated yet connected to the root.  
It was the beginning of parallel development.
