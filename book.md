# Tales in Branches 

## Chapter 1: The First Commit
In the beginning, there was only an empty repository.  
A lone developer wrote the very first file, marking the root commit.  
It was small, but it was the foundation upon which the entire project would grow.

## Chapter 3: The Merge
The branches, though different, were never truly separate.  
They were destined to be merged, bringing the story into one flow again.  
Conflicts sometimes arose, but each resolution made the story stronger.  
In unity, the project found its true form.
